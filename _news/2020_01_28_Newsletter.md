# Invitation: Dissemination/Homepage Update Workshop, Amsterdam, 2020.03.25-26

Working Group 5 is currently drafting a major update for our homepage, and is planning our dissemination strategies for the last period of our COST action and the time after. 

During this workshop we will finalize the homepage updates and test the new system together with thefrontdoor (TFD). Tests will include e.g. the membership management, homepage access rights and social media integration. We also plan to write some homepage content together (e.g. patient information and links to stakeholders.
