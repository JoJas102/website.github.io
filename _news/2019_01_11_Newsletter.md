Dear renalMRI - PARENCHIMA Team! 

we are pleased to inform you about the following news: 

# WG5: Dissemination Workshop - Budapest, Semmelweis

We are pleased to invite you to our first dissemination workshop in Budapest at the Semmelweis University from the 31st of January till the 1st of February 2019.

During our workshop we will present, discuss and optimize our internal and external dissemination work-flow. This will be an excellent opportunity for early career researchers to get in touch with European renal imaging scientists and societies.

This meeting is open to anyone with an interest in our dissemination and exploitation strategies and is free of charge. COST will support this meeting and registered participants will be reimbursed according the COST Vademecum (up to 15). If you are interested to join our discussions, please contact the WG5 Lead in order to get registered. Please add your preferred subject of interest (homepage, newsletter, Google Analytics, social media, stakeholders, companies).

This meeting is organised by the WG5 Lead and the local organiser (Andrea Fekete and Attila Szabó). The draft agenda can be found on the WG website.

# WG2: Algorithms Integration Training Workshop

We are pleased to invite you to the Algorithms Integration Training Workshop held on March 12 and 13 in Valencia. The training will consist of a block of theoretical lessons followed by a guided hands-on. We will provide a sample algorithm to be integrated in the Quibim Precision® platform. If anyone is interested in integrating their own developed algorithms, feel free to bring it with.

This meeting is open to anyone interested in integration of algorithms in the Quibim Precision® platform that is used as the Parenchima database. The meeting is free of charge and registered participants will be reimbursed according to the COST Vademecum. To register use this link or contact WG2 leads.

For more information see the event homepage contact local organizers or WG2 leads.

# WG5: 3rd International Conference on Functional Renal Imaging in Nottingham

Work is now well underway to plan the programme for the 3rd International Conference on Functional Renal Imaging (October 15-17th 2019). We look forward to welcoming you to Nottingham next year! We are building an online registration system, and the conference website will develop as we include new updates and programme [announcements](www.nottingham.ac.uk/go/3rdrenalmri).

Please publicise the conference to colleagues, post-docs and PhD students - we particularly want to encourage attendance of early career researchers. To help with this, we have created some publicity materials (a flier and a powerpoint slide) - please use these at all opportunities, including at the end of talks that you may be giving!

Just a reminder of some important dates:

- Early bird registration deadline: Friday 29th March 2019
- Abstract submission deadline: Monday 1st July 2019
- Online registration deadline: Friday 30th August 2019
