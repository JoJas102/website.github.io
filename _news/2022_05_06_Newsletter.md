Dear all,

Next week during the ISMRM we will held the first renal MRI Study Group meeting, and also the second Member Initiated Symposium on renal MRI will take place. This is very exciting and we like to thank all who helped make this happen. Moreover, the ISMRM will also be a nice opportunity to meet you informally again. As such, via this email we would like to make an inventory of who would like to join us Wednesday May 11th afternoon/evening for drinks/dinner in London? Location and place t.b.a.

Considering we do not have a budget yet, this will be on personal expenses.
If you are interested to join us, please send an email to me [i.a.dekkers@lumc.nl](mailto:i.a.dekkers@lumc.nl).

Best wishes and hopefully see you soon in London,
On behalf of the Renal MRI working group members,

Ilona Dekkers, Vice-chair Renal MRI working group
