Dear colleagues and members of the renal MRI community!

Following up on actions decided during last year's Lisbon/Philadelphia meeting, I am pleased to announce that the governance structure of the new RENALMRI.org network was unanimously approved by 68 voting members. You will find the details here:
[https://renalmri.org/taskforce/34](https://renalmri.org/taskforce/34)

The next step to get this up and running is to collect nominations for the 3 open positions of past chair, chair and vice-chair. If you are interested to fulfill any of these roles, please fill in this form:
[https://forms.gle/tRq6A9yuKkuqGbxZ7](https://forms.gle/tRq6A9yuKkuqGbxZ7)

I will leave this open until 1 march, and then circulate all self-nominations for a final vote to this mailing list. It would be great to have a very large number of candidates - always a sign of a healthy community! Please consider applying if you want to build the momentum that was generated in the past decade and continue driving renal MRI forward!

Best wishes, 
Steven Sourbron
