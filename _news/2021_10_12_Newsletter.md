Dear renalMRI - PARENCHIMA Team!

As discussed at the last meeting of the PARENCHIMA management committee and publicly during the Lisbon sessions of the recent ISMRM workshop on MRI of the Kidney, we are planning to transform PARENCHIMA into a new and more informal network RENALMRI.org that will take the work forward into the future.

After incorporating all feedback received we have now finalized a proposal for a governance structure for RENALMRI.org. It is critical to make sure that our approach is widely supported before we move forward, so can I please ask all of you for a quick vote (Yes or No) on this proposal? The final version can be found here:

And you can vote here (please use your renalMRI.org login email):

Deadline for your submission: 2 November 2021 11:59 pm
