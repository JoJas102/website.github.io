Dear colleagues!

We are pleased to report there is a candidate for each of the open positions in RENALMRI.org, so we are in a great position to keep the network moving. However, it is always nice to have options!  

So if you are interested in getting involved, please consider applying for one of the open positions:
[https://forms.gle/tRq6A9yuKkuqGbxZ7](https://forms.gle/tRq6A9yuKkuqGbxZ7)

We will keep the application open for a little longer with a hard deadline 16 march.

With very best wishes,
Steven Sourbron
