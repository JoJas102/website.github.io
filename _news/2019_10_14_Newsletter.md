We look forward to an exciting meeting! 

# ESR Biomarker Inventory 

We are pleased to inform you that the European Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (EIBALL) research committee of the European Society of Radiology (ESR) has just published a [biomarkers inventory](https://www.myesr.org/research/biomarkers-inventory). Among different anatomical district biomarkers you will find renal ones, including ASL, BOLD, DWI, DTI, PC, T1-mapping, T2-mapping, which are based on our [NDT special issue](https://academic.oup.com/ndt/issue/33/suppl_2). 

Further information will also be available in the upcoming MAGMA publications, which will be also promoted through our website and social media platforms.

# STSM - Grants still available - join forces! 

We would like to remind you that it is still possible to apply for STSM grants! 
In case you are interested please contact the associated working group leader and our STSM Coordinator (Olivera Nikolic). 

Previous STSM reports can be found [here](https://renalmri.org/events#stsm), and don’t forget the “Power pitches and short term scientific missions” during the meeting in Nottingham meeting on Wednesday, October 16th 11:45.

# Homepage Content Update: ISMRM, Member-Initiated Symposium

We have added the Scientific Program on our Homepage. After the great success of our member initiated symposium with about 250 attendees at the ISMRM, we hope to take the momentum to the upcoming ERA-EDTA 2020.
