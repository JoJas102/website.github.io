Dear renalMRI - PARENCHIMA Team! 

we are pleased to inform you about the following news: 

# WG5: Our COST project identity templates online 

We are pleased to inform you that we have placed our COST project identity templates online. They can be found on the [Working Group 5 page](https://renalmri.org/workgroup/5). 

# WG5: 3rd International Conference on Functional Renal Imaging in Nottingham 

This is a kind reminder to our upcoming meeting in Nottingham (October 15th-17th 2019). The program and the registration site is online. Please publicise the conference to colleagues, postdocs and PhD students - we particularly want to encourage attendance of early career researchers. We are looking forward to welcoming you. 

Remember the online registration deadline: Friday 30th August 2019 !

# WG1: MAGMA special issue

All [four consensus papers and overview paper](https://renalmri.org/taskforce/15) on renal ASL, DWI, T1 & T2, BOLD have been successfully submitted and are now under review. If you have relevant renal imaging papers, you could still try to submit them at short notice, even though the deadline has passed. Maybe they can still be included! 

# WG4: Preclinical book

The preclinical book is currently undergoing the editorial review by Prof. Andreas Pholman and Prof. Thoralf Niendorf. 

# WG2: Populating database for imaging data processing

The Task Force 2.1 Database is currently asking for renalMRI members to submit relevant imaging data to populate our upcoming database. Furthermore, if you are interested in joining this task force to help in developing the database further, you are highly welcome. Please contact the WG2 leads in this respect.
