The RENALMRI.org study document repository provides access to documentation of ongoing studies, such as protocols, standard operating procedures and manuals.

These are freely accessible to RENALMRI.org members and may be of use in the start up of your multi-center clinical study. Documents can be accessed via the page of the repository task force.
