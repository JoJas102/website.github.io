## Step 1:	First, make sure you have a GitHub account and are logged in. If you don't have an account, you can create one for free at https://github.com.

## Step 2: 	Go to the renalmri-org/website.github.io that contains the source of the renalmri.org page. Alternatively, you can click [here](https://github.com/renalmri-org/website.github.io) and be taken directly to the repository.

## Step 3: Once you're in the repository, navigate to the file that you want to change. You can do this by clicking on the file in the list of files in the repository, or by using the search bar at the top of the page to search for the file by name.
  - In our example, we do this by first clicking on the _pages folder, which contains the various subpages of the website. The browser should now look like this:

- In our example, we now change the news.md page. To do this, we simply click on the file in the browser.

## Step 4.	When you've found the file you want to change, click on the pencil icon in the top-right corner of the file view to edit the file. This will open the file in the online code editor. 
- Now we can edit the page. Currently the page is still empty.

## Step 5.	Make the changes you want to the file, using the editor. The editor supports syntax highlighting for many different programming languages, so it should be easy to see what you're doing.
- The texts of the website are written in Markdown syntax, alternatively HTML can be used. [Here](#syntax) you can find a short overview of the Markdown syntax.

- We now add the text "My first commit to GitHub".

## Step 6. When you're finished making your changes, scroll down to the bottom of the page and type a brief description of the changes you made in the "Commit changes" box. This will help you and others understand what was changed later on.

## Step 8. If you want to change further files, then proceed analogously to this change. Each additional change will be added in the same pull request. When you have made all the changes, simply click "Create Pull Request" below to send your changes to us. 9. 

## Step 9. Now you will be redirected to the Pull Request page. If you have changed multiple files, you can describe it in the Pull Request message to make it easier for us to understand why something was changed.

#  Markdown syntax

- To create a header, use the # character followed by a space and the header text, with one # for a top-level header and multiple # characters for sub-headers (e.g. ```# Main header```, ```## Sub-header```).
- To create a link, use the ```[link text](url)``` syntax (e.g. ```[Google](https://www.google.com)``` = [Google](https://www.google.com)).
- To add emphasis to text, use ```*``` or ```_``` characters around the text (e.g. ```_italic_``` = _italic_, ```**bold**``` = **bold**).
- To create a bulleted or numbered list, use the * or 1. characters followed by a space and the list item text (e.g. * Item 1, 1. Item 1).
- To create a blockquote, use the > character followed by a space and the quote text (e.g. > This is a blockquote).

## These are just a few examples of Markdown syntax. For a complete reference, you can check out the [official Markdown documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).
