RENALMRI.org joins up organizations across the world that deliver resources on renal MRI for the benefit of the wider community, such as organization of meetings, open access software, data sharing, joint funding applications, patient and public information, standards and consensus statements, etc. 

The organizations listed on this page are currently active. They include ad-hoc task forces that exist temporarily until they deliver on specific aims, but also collaborative national and international projects and dedicated working groups embedded in within larger societies. They commit to being responsive to queries from the community through the contacts provided and to ensure that the content of their pages remains up to date.  

If you want to join any of these organizations, please get in touch with the contacts listed. If you have any questions or suggestions for this page, please contact the RENALMRI.org chair.

If you are involved in a relevant organisation and want to have it listed on this page, please create a page under _community and launch a pull request.
