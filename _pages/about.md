# WEB DEVELOPMENT

The RENALMRI community is grateful to *Serhii Parkhomenko (Dnipro, Ukraine)* for setting up and maintaining the renalmri.org webpage. Contact him on [upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01ebd40dbf6407cae2).

# HISTORY

RENALMRI.org was created by the COST Action PARENCHIMA ([CA16103](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA16103/)), supported by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST). [COST](https://www.cost.eu/) is a funding organization for research and innovation networks. Their Actions help connect research initiatives across Europe and beyond and enable researchers and innovators to grow their ideas in any science and technology field by sharing them with their peers. COST Actions are bottom-up networks with a duration of four years that boost research, innovation and careers.

RENALMRI.org was maintained by PARENCHIMA until the end of the action (1 October 2021). During the 4th international meeting in renal MRI (Lisbon/Philadelphia) the new governance of RENALMRI.org was approved, and the new network was launched.
