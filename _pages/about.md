RENALMRI.org is an open and growing network of researchers and clinicians bringing together, among others, nephrology, radiology, pathology, physiology and physics to promote the clinical translation of functional renal magnetic resonance imaging. 

RENALMRI.org was created by the COST Action PARENCHIMA (CA16103). [COST](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA16103/) is a funding organization for research and innovation networks. Their Actions help connect research initiatives across Europe and beyond and enable researchers and innovators to grow their ideas in any science and technology field by sharing them with their peers. COST Actions are bottom-up networks with a duration of four years that boost research, innovation and careers. 

RENALMRI.org was maintained by PARENCHIMA until the end of the action (1 October 2021). During the 4th international meeting in renal MRI (Lisbon/Philadelphia) the governance of RENALMRI.org was approved and the new network was launched.
